# Contribution Guidelines

Computational Social Sciences crosses many disciplinary boundaries and
a great variety of tools are used which are developed in diverse
areas. Thus, material is scattered and not always accessible to all.
The goal of this awesome list is to become a central place for computational
social scientists (and especially those new to the field) which provides
all resources that are relevant for Computational Social Science. 

Please contribute to the list by sending [pull
requests](https://github.com/gesiscss/awesome-computational-social-science/pulls)
or by fixing an
[issue](https://github.com/gesiscss/awesome-computational-social-science/issues).

Suggestions for new sections, or restructuring of sections are also welcome.

This project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Rules

- Please do not simply copy and paste specific links from other awesome lists. Instead, suggest the inclusion of the whole awesome list if the topic is relevant for Computational Social Science.

- Please don't use this list to promote your own work.

- If possible, write "Computational Social Science" instead of "CSS" to not confuse users who are looking for HTML/CSS awesome resources.
